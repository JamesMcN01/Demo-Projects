# Demo-Projects
In this Git Repo You will find two of my projects that i have done recently.

The first project is my NASA Space apps project where i was in a team of six where we had to choose between multiple challenges and then produce a product/presentaion 
on that product within 48 hours.The challenge we chose was Eclipses: Perspective is Everything		
We developed a Vr interactive learning Game which allowed users to explore a space station while solving puzzels on eclipses and listening to audio to answer questions to reach the end of the game.
Our Team qualified for the global Competion

We carried out standUp meetings through out the 48 hour period and assigned new work to team members when their tasks were completed reguarly.

The Second Project is a solo project for my Game Ai class where i was tasked to create a game that involved what we had learned about ai.
I went above and beyond and planned out my project as decively as i could before starting the actual game, as i developed the game i constantly tested my code to ensure it could work without flaw.
